# Horiseon_Accessability_Challenge

## Description
Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc., a marketing agency, needed a refactor of their codebase in order to follow accessability standards to optimize their website for search engines. The Horiseon website also had features in their site that were not functioning and needed to be fixed.
