# Horiseon_Accessability_Challenge
## Description

Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc., a marketing agency, needed a codebase that followed accessability standards to optimize their website for search engines. Helping Horiseon to make their website accessibe will ensure that people with disabilities can have access to view their website as well as increase Horiseon's ranking in search engines. Throughout this project I learned that structure and order within the code is essential for a clean and functional website.
